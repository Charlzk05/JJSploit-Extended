# Excluding from anti-virus software

Unfortunately, WeAreDevsAPI has always had issues with anti-virus software due to the nature of how it works. WeAreDevsAPI uses techniques that are also commonly used by malicious programs, which causes false positives in anti-virus software.

To begin, launch the "Windows Security" app from the start menu.

Then, select the "Virus & threat protection" tab.

Finally, pick the directory that we extracted earlier from the zip file by clicking "Add an exclusion," "Folder," and then "Folder".
